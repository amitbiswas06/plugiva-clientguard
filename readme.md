# Plugiva ClientGuard

Plugiva ClientGuard is a WordPress admin safety plugin designed to prevent accidental or unauthorized changes in the WordPress dashboard.

It adds calm, predictable guardrails around sensitive admin actions such as plugin management, theme switching, menu visibility, and protected content — without trying to act as a security or firewall solution.

> ClientGuard focuses on operational safety, not security theater.

## What This Plugin Is (and Is Not)

### What it is
- A safety layer for WordPress admins and clients
- A way to prevent accidental clicks and destructive changes
- A tool to enforce intentional workflows in shared admin environments

### What it is not
- Not a security plugin
- Not a firewall or malware scanner
- Not a replacement for proper authentication or backups

ClientGuard assumes WordPress is already secured by standard best practices and focuses on reducing human error.
