# Plugiva ClientGuard

Plugiva ClientGuard is a WordPress plugin designed to prevent accidental changes in the admin area by adding safe, intentional guardrails.

Rather than enforcing strict access control, ClientGuard helps maintain site stability while keeping the admin experience calm and predictable.
